**Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è using React Native and Expo** 

## 1. **Check the Terminal Output**
- You should see something like:
  ```
  ‚Ä∫ Web is waiting on http://localhost:8083
  ```
- If you see this, the Metro Bundler is running and serving the web app.

## 2. **Open the Correct URL**
- Open your browser and go to:  
  **http://localhost:8083**  
  or  
  **http://127.0.0.1:8083**

## 3. **If the Page is Blank or Not Loading**
- **Open the browser console (F12 > Console tab)**
- Look for any red error messages and copy them here.

## 4. **Common Issues and Fixes**

### **A. Port Blocked or In Use**
- If you see a message about the port being in use, Metro will pick another port (e.g., 8082, 8083). Make sure you use the port shown in the terminal.

### **B. Firewall or Antivirus**
- Sometimes, Windows Firewall or antivirus blocks local ports. Try temporarily disabling them and reload the page.

### **C. Browser Cache**
- Hard refresh the page:  
  **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)

### **D. App Crash/Error**
- If you see a red error screen or nothing loads, check the browser console for errors.
- If you see a FlatList or React error, please copy the error message here.

### **E. Metro Bundler Not Running**
- Make sure the terminal is open and running `expo start` or `npm start` in the `MyFirstApp` directory.

### **F. Network Issues**
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- Try `http://localhost:8083` and `http://127.0.0.1:8083`.

---

## 5. **If Still Not Working**
- Please copy and paste:
  - The **exact error message** from your browser console
  - The **terminal output** after you run `npm start`
  - A screenshot or description of what you see in the browser

---

**Let me know what you see in the browser and in the console, and I‚Äôll help you fix it step by step!** 

---

### 1. **Make sure the repository exists**
- Go to: https://github.com/xrincx321/FirstAssessment
- If it does not exist, create it (do not add a README, .gitignore, or license).

---

### 2. **Set up authentication (if private or if you get prompted for a password)**
- If your repo is private, you need a GitHub personal access token (PAT).
- [Create a token here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (classic, with `repo` scope).
- When prompted for a password during push, use your GitHub username and the token as the password.

---

### 3. **Push your code**
Since you already committed your files, run:
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
If you get an authentication prompt, use your username and the token.

---

#### If you see ‚ÄúRepository not found‚Äù:
- Double-check the repo URL and spelling.
- Make sure you are logged in as `xrincx321`.
- Make sure the repo is created and you have access.

---

**If you want, I can try the push again now, but if authentication is required, you‚Äôll need to enter your username and token in your terminal. Would you like to proceed?**  
If yes, please run:
```sh
git push -u origin main
```
in your terminal and follow the authentication prompt.

Let me know if you encounter any errors or need help with the token! 

Congratulations! üéâ  
If your code is now showing in your GitHub repository, that means you have successfully pushed your project to GitHub.

You can now:
- Share your repository link with others.
- Continue working and push new changes using:
  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your message"
  git push
  ```
- Collaborate with others or use GitHub features like Issues, Pull Requests, etc.

If you need help with anything else‚Äîlike making future commits, branching, or collaborating‚Äîjust let me know! 

Thank you for pointing that out!  
If your `MyFirstApp` folder on GitHub only shows:
- `.gitignore`
- `package-lock.json`
- `package.json`

but **does not show your actual code files** (like `App.js`, `index.js`, etc.), it means only those files were tracked and pushed, or the rest were ignored or not added.

---

## Here‚Äôs how to fix it and upload all your code:

### 1. **Check if the files exist locally**
- Make sure you see files like `App.js`, `index.js`, and others inside `MyFirstApp` on your computer.

### 2. **Check your .gitignore**
- Open `.gitignore` in your project root and in `MyFirstApp/` and make sure it does NOT contain rules that would ignore your code files (like `*.js` or `App.js`).

### 3. **Add all files in MyFirstApp**
In your terminal, run:
```sh
git add MyFirstApp/*
git add MyFirstApp/*/*
```
This will stage all files and subfolders inside `MyFirstApp`.

### 4. **Commit the changes**
```sh
git commit -m "Add missing source files in MyFirstApp"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

---

**After this, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should now see all your code files inside `MyFirstApp`.**

If you want, I can guide you step by step or help you troubleshoot if any files are still missing! 

---

Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to make sure all your code files in `MyFirstApp` are uploaded to GitHub:

---

## **Step 1: Check Your Files Locally**
- Open the `MyFirstApp` folder on your computer.
- Make sure you see files like `App.js`, `index.js`, and any other source files you want to upload.

---

## **Step 2: Check .gitignore**
- Open the `.gitignore` file in your project root and in `MyFirstApp/` (if it exists).
- Make sure it does **not** contain lines like `*.js` or `App.js` that would ignore your code files.

---

## **Step 3: Remove Submodule Reference (if it exists)**
If you previously added `MyFirstApp` as a submodule, run:
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
*(The second command removes the `.git` folder inside `MyFirstApp` if it exists, making it a normal folder.)*

---

## **Step 4: Add All Files in MyFirstApp**
Run these commands in your terminal:
```sh
git add MyFirstApp/*
git add MyFirstApp/*/*
```
*(This will stage all files and subfolders inside `MyFirstApp`.)*

---

## **Step 5: Commit the Changes**
```sh
git commit -m "Add missing source files in MyFirstApp"
```

---

## **Step 6: Push to GitHub**
```sh
git push
```

---

## **Step 7: Check Your Repository**
- Go to your GitHub repo page and refresh.
- You should now see all your code files inside the `MyFirstApp` folder.
